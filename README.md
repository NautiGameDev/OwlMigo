# OwlMigo

## Project Overview
OwlMigo is a simple MVP for a pen pal webapp made using React for the front-end SPA and ASP.NET for the back-end API. The project includes foundational features that would be necessary to create a modern pen pal website, including JWT authentication for user log in, account creation, profile onboarding process, profiles, search functions, and a letter system.

## Tech
* React single page application for UI display in a single page application
* ASP.NET RESTful API with defined user roles and JWT authentication
* SQL Server Express Database (Not included in repo)

## Key Features
* **Multi-Step Onboarding:** Comprehensive process gathering interests, language fluency, and platform goals to build rich user profiles.
* **Privacy Controls:** Toggleable settings for anonymity and platonic interaction preferences.
* **JWT Authentication:** Secure identity management using Bearer tokens for authorized communication between React and ASP.NET
* **Dynamic Search Engine:** Flexible search system using query-building methodology to filter search results
* **Optimized Relational Mapping:** Many-to-many relationship management through virtual collections and EF Core navigation properties for efficient data retrieval.
